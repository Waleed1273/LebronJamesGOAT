    <div class="box" id = 'box1'>
    <h2>The Increbible Consistency</h2>
    <p>Nobody in the history of the NBA has had the sustained excellence LeBron James, the playmaking, the athelticism, and the overall ability to play the game at an <i>incredible level</i>.
        <br>This was only cemented by his performance at the Paris 2024 Olympics, in which he was the FMVP, and how he was the cornerstone for a USA team loaded with superstars and Hall of Famers.
        <br>Even at 27, LeBron was drawing MJ comparisions, and was, for a fact, the best player in the NBA, KD, Melo, Kobe, not even close.</p>

            <p><br>While it is undeniable Michael Jordan had a higher peak, the King's consistency over 20 seasons, and especially when married to the excellence of one of the word's best players, even at 40, is just to big to ignore.</p>
